// diner through likes → dislikes → budget → location, one question at a time.
// Dietary needs are NOT asked here — they're captured once in onboarding
// (`Profile.dietary_restrictions`) and feed the ranking hard-filter directly, so
// the session chat never re-asks them. The event's occasion and time are also NOT
// asked here — the host sets those once in the pre-session modal
// (`HostSessionModal`), so the chat never touches them for host or member alike.
//
// `AGENT_ASK_ORDER` is the exact signal-name vocabulary the analyze endpoint
// returns in `missing_signals`, so the UI can key chips / the "current question"
// off it directly.

// Signal names in ask-order — identical to the backend's `_MISSING_ORDER`.
