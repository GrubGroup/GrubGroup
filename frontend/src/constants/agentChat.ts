// The HOST is NOT asked for a location (they set the group location in the
// pre-session modal), so their flow is likes → dislikes → budget — see
// `askOrderFor`, mirroring `conversation_agent._ask_order(is_host)`.
// Dietary needs are NOT asked here — they're captured once in onboarding
// (`Profile.dietary_restrictions`) and feed the ranking hard-filter directly, so
// the session chat never re-asks them. The event's occasion and time are also NOT
// asked here — the host sets those once in the pre-session modal
// (`HostSessionModal`), so the chat never touches them for host or member alike.
//
// `AGENT_ASK_ORDER` is the exact signal-name vocabulary the analyze endpoint
// returns in `missing_signals`, so the UI can key chips / the "current question"
// off it directly.
