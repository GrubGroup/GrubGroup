"""Interactive, type-your-own-answers walkthrough of the preference sub-agent.

This is the *interactive* sibling of ``scripts/demo_orchestrator.py``. Where the
demo scripts every member's Q&A answers as canned strings, THIS script hands the
keyboard to a tester: you play ONE member and *type* free-text answers to your
own AI preference sub-agent, watch it echo back what it captured, and then the
real master orchestrator reconciles the whole group and produces the TOP-5
restaurant picks. The other members auto-fill from the demo personas.

It is the terminal preview of the frontend ``AgentChatPage`` flow: a member
chats with their personal agent, a "noted so far" panel fills in, they finish
sharing, and the group lands on a shortlist (``TopPicksPage``).

Two important honesty notes — the same spirit as the demo's mocked providers:

  * **There is no wired free-text -> preferences logic in the backend.** The real
    ``normalize_member`` (app/ai/agents/preference_agent.py) is deterministic: it
    copies structured ``Profile`` columns straight through. So this script does
    the extraction itself — offline via a deterministic keyword/regex extractor
    over the *real* seed-catalog vocabulary (default), or via the real LLM under
    ``--live`` — then hands a structured Profile dict to the REAL
    ``normalize_member``. The resulting ``MemberPref`` is genuinely the agent's.
  * **The sub-agent's spoken reply is a templated UX stand-in.** The backend has
    no reply-generation logic (just like the demo's ``_mock_rerank_response``).
    The captured *signals* are real; only the conversational phrasing is scripted.

Modes:

  * DEFAULT (offline): no DB, no API keys, deterministic. Extraction is a local
    keyword/regex pass; retrieval + re-rank reuse the demo's offline stand-ins
    over the real seed catalog. Runs anywhere, including CI (piped stdin).
  * ``--live``: real OpenRouter embeddings + real pgvector search + real
    Salesforce/Claude extraction & re-rank, over the mock group. Needs a running
    DB + API keys (like the smoke test). Read/compute only — no rows written.

Run:
    cd backend/ai_service
    uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session                    # you play Alice (vegan)
    uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session --member bob        # play a different persona
    uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session --all-interactive   # type for every member
    uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session --answers-file a.txt # feed answers from a file
    uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session --live              # real backend path
    printf 'vegan\\nthai\\nno steak\\n$15 to 40\\n' | uv run python -m scripts.interactive_session

In-conversation commands: ``:skip`` (skip this question), ``:done`` (stop early),
``:quit`` (abort), ``:help`` (show commands).
