"""Narrated, mock-data walkthrough of the group recommendation pipeline.

This is the *demo* sibling of ``scripts/smoke_orchestrator.py``. Where the smoke
test proves the wiring works and prints terse ``[n/4]`` progress, this script is
built to be *watched in a terminal*: it narrates, step by step, exactly what
happens when a group of friends each talk to their own AI preference sub-agent
and a master orchestrator reconciles everyone into one ranked shortlist.

It prints, in order:

  * WHO the mock users are (the group roster + personas).
  * the group session Q&A (occasion / location / budget / time — the ``Qa`` row).
  * each member's spoken answers to their preference sub-agent's questions,
    and the sub-agent's normalized output (the real ``MemberPref``).
  * the master orchestrator's work: reconcile constraints -> build a query ->
    embed it -> hit the restaurant database (pgvector retrieval) -> LLM re-rank.
  * the final TOP 5 restaurants for the whole group, with justifications.

It is the terminal version of what the frontend will show once the backend is
wired to real user voice input. Two modes:

  * DEFAULT (offline mock): no database, no API keys, fully deterministic. It
    drives the *real* pipeline building blocks (``normalize_member``,
    ``_reconcile``, ``_build_query_text``, ``_parse_ranked``) and the *real*
    seed catalog, swapping only the three network/DB providers (embeddings,
    pgvector search, the LLM call) for local deterministic stand-ins. Anyone on
    the team can run it and always see a full top-5.
  * ``--live``: runs the real providers instead — real OpenRouter embeddings,
    real pgvector search against the seeded database, and the real Salesforce/
    Claude re-rank — over the same mock group. Needs a running DB + API keys
    (like the smoke test). No rows are written; this is a read/compute demo.

Run:
    cd backend/ai_service
    uv run python -m scripts.demo_orchestrator            # offline mock (default)
    uv run python -m scripts.demo_orchestrator --live     # real backend path
    uv run python -m scripts.demo_orchestrator --no-color  # disable ANSI colors

#
# Four deliberately DIVERGENT diners so the orchestrator's reconcile step does
# real work (dietary union, budget-min cap, cuisine weighting) rather than
# trivially agreeing — the same design idea as smoke_orchestrator, expanded to
# four so the top-5 is a genuine selection among many valid candidates.
#
# Each member carries a scripted `qa_turns` dialogue (agent question -> spoken
# answer). Those spoken answers map onto the structured Profile fields below;
# `normalize_member` (the real agent) then produces the MemberPref from the
# structured fields — exactly as it will from real saved profiles in prod.

MockMember = dict[str, Any]

# Each member has a durable `profile` (their saved Profile columns — the pipeline
# fan-out reads these, and dietary_restrictions hard-filters from HERE since Qa
# has no dietary column) and a scripted `analyze_turns` conversation with their
# QA sub-agent. Every turn is (agent_question, spoken_answer, offline_delta):
#   * agent_question / spoken_answer — narration; the answer is what --live sends
#     verbatim to the real gateway.
#   * offline_delta — a compact description of what the OFFLINE LLM stand-in
#     "extracts" from that answer, in the analyze-turn JSON contract's terms.
#     The REAL analyze_turn then runs its reconcile/expand/removal/reply logic
#     over it, so cuisine GROUPS expand ("asian" -> its members), STYLES are
#     recorded ("steakhouse"), and corrections/adds/removals apply for real.
# Delta keys (all optional): preferred / disliked / dietary (ADD these terms);
#   set_preferred / set_disliked (REPLACE the list — a correction); remove_*
#   (drop these terms); budget_min / budget_max (ints). Cuisines here are the
#   member's SESSION overrides (-> their Qa row's qa_* fields); dietary is asked
#   for realism but is NOT persisted to Qa (it lives on the durable Profile).
