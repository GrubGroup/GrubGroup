    Workflow (mirrors recommendation_service's load -> compute -> persist shape):
      1. Resolve the caller's role for this session: is_host = (the session's
         host_user_id == payload.user_id). Only the host may set the event-level
         occasion; a member's turn never captures or writes it.
      2. Run the conversational agent (LLM parse + reconcile against prior
         signals; graceful degradation is handled inside analyze_turn), passing
         is_host so it asks the host-only questions of the host alone.
      3. IN A SESSION (session_id present): persist ONLY the member's session-
         scoped Qa row (their temporary override for this event) — the durable
         Profile is deliberately NOT written, so a session's answers never mutate
         a user's saved preferences. The Profile is read elsewhere (the pipeline)
         purely as the fallback when the member did not override a field.
      4. OUTSIDE A SESSION (session_id is None — the /analyze profile-edit turn):
         no Qa exists, so persist the durable Profile diff when
         payload.persist_profile is set. This keeps the profile-editor path
         working while the in-session sub-agent stays read-only on Profile.
      5. Return the full DTO-ready dict — extracted_signals + reply + missing +
         what was actually written — regardless of whether persistence ran.
