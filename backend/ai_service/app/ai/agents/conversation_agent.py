"""Conversational preference sub-agent: LLM parse + reconcile + agent reply.

This is the non-deterministic sibling of ``preference_agent.normalize_member``
(which stays deterministic, copying structured Profile columns). ``analyze_turn``
drives one turn of the per-member QA conversation: it reads the new message in
the context of prior turns + already-known signals, extracts/updates the
preference signal set (dietary / cuisines / budget / a member's optional
location), handles corrections against the prior signals, and produces a
natural-language reply that confirms what was captured and asks the next missing
question. It walks the same dietary -> likes -> dislikes -> budget -> location
flow as ``scripts/interactive_session.py``; the event's occasion and time are NOT
part of this conversation — the host sets them once in the pre-session modal
(``Session.scheduled_for`` + the host's seeded ``Qa.occasion``), so no chat turn,
host or member, ever asks for or extracts them.

It degrades gracefully: on any parse/transport failure it returns the prior
signals unchanged plus a safe reply, so a flaky LLM never turns a turn into a
500 (the endpoint layer still maps genuine transport errors to 502).
